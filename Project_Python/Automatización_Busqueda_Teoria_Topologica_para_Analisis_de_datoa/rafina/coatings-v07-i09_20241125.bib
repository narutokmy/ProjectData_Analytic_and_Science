ABSTRACT = {Due to recent climate change-triggered, regular dust storms in the Middle East, dust mitigation has become the critical issue for solar energy harvesting devices. One of the methods to minimize and prevent dust adhesion and create self-cleaning abilities is to generate hydrophobic characteristics on surfaces. The purpose of this study is to explore the topological features of hydrophobic surfaces. We use non-standard techniques from topological data analysis to extract morphological features from the AFM images. Our method recovers most of the previous qualitative observations in a robust and quantitative way. Persistence diagrams, which is a summary of topological structures, witness quantitatively that the crystallized polycarbonate (PC) surface possesses spherulites, voids, and fibrils, and the texture height and spherulite concentration increases with the increased immersion period. The approach also shows that the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) exactly copied the structures at the PC surface but 80 to 90 percent of the nanofibrils were not copied at PDMS surface. We next extract a feature vector from each persistence diagram to show which experiments hold features with similar variance using principal component analysis (PCA). The K-means clustering algorithm is applied to the matrix of feature vectors to support the PCA result, grouping experiments with similar features.},

ABSTRACT = {The recent droughts in the American Southwest have led to increasing risks of wildfires, which pose multiple threats to the regional and national economy and security. Wildfires cause serious air quality issues during dry seasons and can increase the number of mud and landslides in any subsequent rainy seasons. However, while wildfires are often correlated with warm and dry climates, this relationship is not linear, implying that there may be other factors influencing these fires. The objective of this study was to detect and classify any nonlinear patterns in weather data by applying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to various weather variables, such as temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation, and the five most and least intense summer fire seasons as determined by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire products. In addition to TDA, persistence diagrams and frequency plots were also used to compare fire seasons and regions in the American Southwest. Active fire seasons were more likely to have a significant correlation between the weather variables and wildfires, the Fire Weather Index (FWI) alone was not an accurate predictor for wildfires in California and Nevada, and fire weather is highly dependent upon the region and season.},

ABSTRACT = {Bifurcations in dynamical systems characterize qualitative changes in the system behavior. Therefore, their detection is important because they can signal the transition from normal system operation to imminent failure. In an experimental setting, this transition could lead to incorrect data or damage to the entire experiment. While standard persistent homology has been used in this setting, it usually requires analyzing a collection of persistence diagrams, which in turn drives up the computational cost considerably. Using zigzag persistence, we can capture topological changes in the state space of the dynamical system in only one persistence diagram. Here, we present Bifurcations using ZigZag (BuZZ), a one-step method to study and detect bifurcations using zigzag persistence. The BuZZ method is successfully able to detect this type of behavior in two synthetic examples as well as an example dynamical system.},

ABSTRACT = {Structural asymmetries in language-related brain regions have long been hypothesized to underlie hemispheric language laterality and variability in language functions. These structural asymmetries have been examined using voxel-level, gross volumetric, and surface area measures of gray matter and white matter. Here we used deformation-based and persistent homology approaches to characterize the three-dimensional topology of brain structure asymmetries within language-related areas that were defined in functional neuroimaging experiments. Persistence diagrams representing the range of values for each spatially unique structural asymmetry were collected within language-related regions of interest across 212 children (mean age (years) = 10.56, range 6.39–16.92; 39% female). These topological data exhibited both leftward and rightward asymmetries within the same language-related regions. Permutation testing demonstrated that age and sex effects were most consistent and pronounced in the superior temporal sulcus, where older children and males had more rightward asymmetries. While, consistent with previous findings, these associations exhibited small effect sizes that were observable because of the relatively large sample. In addition, the density of rightward asymmetry structures in nearly all language-related regions was consistently higher than the density of leftward asymmetric structures. These findings guide the prediction that the topological pattern of structural asymmetries in language-related regions underlies the organization of language.},

ABSTRACT = {Stability of persistence diagrams under slight perturbations is a key characteristic behind the validity and growing popularity of topological data analysis in exploring real-world data. Central to this stability is the use of Bottleneck distance which entails matching points between diagrams. Instances of use of this metric in practical studies have, however, been few and sparingly far between because of the computational obstruction, especially in dimension zero where the computational cost explodes with the growth of data size. We present a novel efficient algorithm to compute dimension zero bottleneck distance between two persistent diagrams of a specific kind which runs significantly faster and provides significantly sharper approximates with respect to the output of the original algorithm than any other available algorithm. We bypass the overwhelming matching problem in previous implementations of the bottleneck distance, and prove that the zero dimensional bottleneck distance can be recovered from a very small number of matching cases. Partly in keeping with nomenclature traditions in this area of TDA, we name this algorithm Lumáwig as a nod to a deity in the northern Philippines, where the algorithm was developed. We show that Lumáwig generally enjoys linear complexity as shown by empirical tests. We also present an application that leverages dimension zero persistence diagrams and the bottleneck distance to produce features for classification tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Methods of topological data analysis have been successfully applied in a wide range of fields to provide useful summaries of the structure of complex data sets in terms of topological descriptors, such as persistence diagrams. While there are many powerful techniques for computing topological descriptors, the inverse problem, i.e., recovering the input data from topological descriptors, has proved to be challenging. In this article, we study in detail the Topological Morphology Descriptor (TMD), which assigns a persistence diagram to any tree embedded in Euclidean space, and a sort of stochastic inverse to the TMD, the Topological Neuron Synthesis (TNS) algorithm, gaining both theoretical and computational insights into the relation between the two. We propose a new approach to classify barcodes using symmetric groups, which provides a concrete language to formulate our results. We investigate to what extent the TNS recovers a geometric tree from its TMD and describe the effect of different types of noise on the process of tree generation from persistence diagrams. We prove moreover that the TNS algorithm is stable with respect to specific types of noise.},

ABSTRACT = {Time series clustering is an essential ingredient of unsupervised learning techniques. It provides an understanding of the intrinsic properties of data upon exploiting similarity measures. Traditional similarity-based methods usually consider local geometric properties of raw time series or the global topological properties of time series in the phase space. In order to overcome their limitations, we put forward a time series clustering framework, referred to as time series clustering with Topological-Geometric Mixed Distance (TGMD), which jointly considers local geometric features and global topological characteristics of time series data. More specifically, persistent homology is employed to extract topological features of time series and to compute topological similarities among persistence diagrams. The geometric properties of raw time series are captured by using shape-based similarity measures such as Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping. The effectiveness of the proposed TGMD method is assessed by extensive experiments on synthetic noisy biological and real time series data. The results reveal that the proposed mixed distance-based similarity measure can lead to promising results and that it performs better than standard time series analysis techniques that consider only topological or geometrical similarity.},

ABSTRACT = {We use topological data analysis tools for studying the inner organization of cells in segmented images of epithelial tissues. More specifically, for each segmented image, we compute different persistence barcodes, which codify the lifetime of homology classes (persistent homology) along different filtrations (increasing nested sequences of simplicial complexes) that are built from the regions representing the cells in the tissue. We use a complete and well-grounded set of numerical variables over those persistence barcodes, also known as topological summaries. A novel combination of normalization methods for both the set of input segmented images and the produced barcodes allows for the proven stability results for those variables with respect to small changes in the input, as well as invariance to image scale. Our study provides new insights to this problem, such as a possible novel indicator for the development of the drosophila wing disc tissue or the importance of centroids’ distribution to differentiate some tissues from their CVT-path counterpart (a mathematical model of epithelia based on Voronoi diagrams). We also show how the use of topological summaries may improve the classification accuracy of epithelial images using a Random Forest algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this work is to perform image quality assessment (IQA) of eye fundus images in the context of digital fundoscopy with topological data analysis (TDA) and machine learning methods. Eye health remains inaccessible for a large amount of the global population. Digital tools that automize the eye exam could be used to address this issue. IQA is a fundamental step in digital fundoscopy for clinical applications; it is one of the first steps in the preprocessing stages of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems using eye fundus images. Images from the EyePACS dataset were used, and quality labels from previous works in the literature were selected. Cubical complexes were used to represent the images; the grayscale version was, then, used to calculate a persistent homology on the simplex and represented with persistence diagrams. Then, 30 vectorized topological descriptors were calculated from each image and used as input to a classification algorithm. Six different algorithms were tested for this study (SVM, decision tree, k-NN, random forest, logistic regression (LoGit), MLP). LoGit was selected and used for the classification of all images, given the low computational cost it carries. Performance results on the validation subset showed a global accuracy of 0.932, precision of 0.912 for label “quality” and 0.952 for label “no quality”, recall of 0.932 for label “quality” and 0.912 for label “no quality”, AUC of 0.980, F1 score of 0.932, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.864. This work offers evidence for the use of topological methods for the process of quality assessment of eye fundus images, where a relatively small vector of characteristics (30 in this case) can enclose enough information for an algorithm to yield classification results useful in the clinical settings of a digital fundoscopy pipeline for CAD.},

ABSTRACT = {We introduce here a novel machine learning (ML) framework to address the issue of the quantitative assessment of the immune content in neuroblastoma (NB) specimens. First, the EUNet, a U-Net with an EfficientNet encoder, is trained to detect lymphocytes on tissue digital slides stained with the CD3 T-cell marker. The training set consists of 3782 images extracted from an original collection of 54 whole slide images (WSIs), manually annotated for a total of 73,751 lymphocytes. Resampling strategies, data augmentation, and transfer learning approaches are adopted to warrant reproducibility and to reduce the risk of overfitting and selection bias. Topological data analysis (TDA) is then used to define activation maps from different layers of the neural network at different stages of the training process, described by persistence diagrams (PD) and Betti curves. TDA is further integrated with the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction and the hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for clustering, by the deep features, the relevant subgroups and structures, across different levels of the neural network. Finally, the recent TwoNN approach is leveraged to study the variation of the intrinsic dimensionality of the U-Net model. As the main task, the proposed pipeline is employed to evaluate the density of lymphocytes over the whole tissue area of the WSIs. The model achieves good results with mean absolute error 3.1 on test set, showing significant agreement between densities estimated by our EUNet model and by trained pathologists, thus indicating the potentialities of a promising new strategy in the quantification of the immune content in NB specimens. Moreover, the UMAP algorithm unveiled interesting patterns compatible with pathological characteristics, also highlighting novel insights into the dynamics of the intrinsic dataset dimensionality at different stages of the training process. All the experiments were run on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.},

ABSTRACT = {Persistent homology is a powerful tool in topological data analysis (TDA) to compute, study, and encode efficiently multi-scale topological features and is being increasingly used in digital image classification. The topological features represent a number of connected components, cycles, and voids that describe the shape of data. Persistent homology extracts the birth and death of these topological features through a filtration process. The lifespan of these features can be represented using persistent diagrams (topological signatures). Cubical homology is a more efficient method for extracting topological features from a 2D image and uses a collection of cubes to compute the homology, which fits the digital image structure of grids. In this research, we propose a cubical homology-based algorithm for extracting topological features from 2D images to generate their topological signatures. Additionally, we propose a novel score measure, which measures the significance of each of the sub-simplices in terms of persistence. In addition, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and contrast limited adapting histogram equalization (CLAHE) are used as supplementary methods for extracting features. Supervised machine learning models are trained on selected image datasets to study the efficacy of the extracted topological features. Among the eight tested models with six published image datasets of varying pixel sizes, classes, and distributions, our experiments demonstrate that cubical homology-based machine learning with the deep residual network (ResNet 1D) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM) shows promise with the extracted topological features.},

ABSTRACT = {A rapid and accurate detection of ventricular arrhythmias is essential to take appropriate therapeutic actions when cardiac arrhythmias occur. Furthermore, the accurate discrimination between arrhythmias is also important, provided that the required shocking therapy would not be the same. In this work, the main novelty is the use of the mathematical method known as Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to generate new types of features which can contribute to the improvement of the detection and classification performance of cardiac arrhythmias such as Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). The electrocardiographic (ECG) signals used for this evaluation were obtained from the standard MIT-BIH and AHA databases. Two input data to the classify are evaluated: TDA features, and Persistence Diagram Image (PDI). Using the reduced TDA-obtained features, a high average accuracy near 99% was observed when discriminating four types of rhythms (98.68% to VF; 99.05% to VT; 98.76% to normal sinus; and 99.09% to Other rhythms) with specificity values higher than 97.16% in all cases. In addition, a higher accuracy of 99.51% was obtained when discriminating between shockable (VT/VF) and non-shockable rhythms (99.03% sensitivity and 99.67% specificity). These results show that the use of TDA-derived geometric features, combined in this case this the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, raises the classification performance above results in previous works. Considering that these results have been achieved without preselection of ECG episodes, it can be concluded that these features may be successfully introduced in Automated External Defibrillation (AED) and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillation (ICD) therapies.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we develop a pipeline that associates Persistence Diagrams to digital data via the most appropriate filtration for the type of data considered. Using a grid search approach, this pipeline determines optimal representation methods and parameters. The development of such a topological pipeline for Machine Learning involves two crucial steps that strongly affect its performance: firstly, digital data must be represented as an algebraic object with a proper associated filtration in order to compute its topological summary, the Persistence Diagram. Secondly, the persistence diagram must be transformed with suitable representation methods in order to be introduced in a Machine Learning algorithm. We assess the performance of our pipeline, and in parallel, we compare the different representation methods on popular benchmark datasets. This work is a first step toward both an easy and ready-to-use pipeline for data classification using persistent homology and Machine Learning, and to understand the theoretical reasons why, given a dataset and a task to be performed, a pair (filtration, topological representation) is better than another.},

ABSTRACT = {An important tool in the field of topological data analysis is persistent homology (PH), which is used to encode abstract representations of the homology of data at different resolutions in the form of persistence barcode (PB). Normally, one will obtain one PB from a digital image when using a sublevel-set filtration method. In this work, we built more than one PB representation of a single image based on a landmark selection method, known as local binary patterns (LBP), which encode different types of local texture from a digital image. Starting from the top-left corner of any 3-by-3 patch selected from an input image, the LBP process starts by subtracting the central pixel value from its eight neighboring pixel values. Then, each cell is assigned with 1 if the subtraction outcome is positive, and 0 otherwise, to obtain an 8-bit binary representation. This process will identify a set of landmark pixels to represent 0-simplices and use Vietoris–Rips filtration to obtain its corresponding PB. Using LBP, we can construct up to 56 PBs from a single image if we restrict to only using the binary codes that have two circular transitions between 1 and 0. The information within these 56 PBs contain detailed local and global topological and geometrical information, which can be used to design effective machine learning models. We used four different PB vectorizations, namely, persistence landscapes, persistence images, Betti curves (barcode binning), and PB statistics. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed landmark-based PH on two publicly available breast abnormality detection datasets using mammogram scans. The sensitivity and specificity of the landmark-based PH obtained was over 90% and 85%, respectively, in both datasets for the detection of abnormal breast scans. Finally, the experimental results provide new insights on using different PB vectorizations with sublevel set filtrations and landmark-based Vietoris–Rips filtration from digital mammogram scans.},

ABSTRACT = {With the advancement of IoT technologies, there is a large amount of data available from wireless sensor networks (WSN), particularly for studying climate change. Clustering long and noisy time series has become an important research area for analyzing this data. This paper proposes a feature-based clustering approach using topological data analysis, which is a set of methods for finding topological structure in data. Persistence diagrams and landscapes are popular topological summaries that can be used to cluster time series. This paper presents a framework for selecting an optimal number of persistence landscapes, and using them as features in an unsupervised learning algorithm. This approach reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy. The clustering approach was demonstrated to be accurate on simulated data, based on only four, three, and three features, respectively, selected in Scenarios 1–3. On real data, consisting of multiple long temperature streams from various US locations, our optimal feature selection method achieved approximately a 13 times speed-up in computing.},
