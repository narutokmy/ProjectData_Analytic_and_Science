ABSTRACT = {A rapid and accurate detection of ventricular arrhythmias is essential to take appropriate therapeutic actions when cardiac arrhythmias occur. Furthermore, the accurate discrimination between arrhythmias is also important, provided that the required shocking therapy would not be the same. In this work, the main novelty is the use of the mathematical method known as Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to generate new types of features which can contribute to the improvement of the detection and classification performance of cardiac arrhythmias such as Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). The electrocardiographic (ECG) signals used for this evaluation were obtained from the standard MIT-BIH and AHA databases. Two input data to the classify are evaluated: TDA features, and Persistence Diagram Image (PDI). Using the reduced TDA-obtained features, a high average accuracy near 99% was observed when discriminating four types of rhythms (98.68% to VF; 99.05% to VT; 98.76% to normal sinus; and 99.09% to Other rhythms) with specificity values higher than 97.16% in all cases. In addition, a higher accuracy of 99.51% was obtained when discriminating between shockable (VT/VF) and non-shockable rhythms (99.03% sensitivity and 99.67% specificity). These results show that the use of TDA-derived geometric features, combined in this case this the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, raises the classification performance above results in previous works. Considering that these results have been achieved without preselection of ECG episodes, it can be concluded that these features may be successfully introduced in Automated External Defibrillation (AED) and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillation (ICD) therapies.},

ABSTRACT = {With the advancement of IoT technologies, there is a large amount of data available from wireless sensor networks (WSN), particularly for studying climate change. Clustering long and noisy time series has become an important research area for analyzing this data. This paper proposes a feature-based clustering approach using topological data analysis, which is a set of methods for finding topological structure in data. Persistence diagrams and landscapes are popular topological summaries that can be used to cluster time series. This paper presents a framework for selecting an optimal number of persistence landscapes, and using them as features in an unsupervised learning algorithm. This approach reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy. The clustering approach was demonstrated to be accurate on simulated data, based on only four, three, and three features, respectively, selected in Scenarios 1–3. On real data, consisting of multiple long temperature streams from various US locations, our optimal feature selection method achieved approximately a 13 times speed-up in computing.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the last two decades, topological data analysis (TDA) has emerged as a very powerful data analytic approach that can deal with various data modalities of varying complexities. One of the most commonly used tools in TDA is persistent homology (PH), which can extract topological properties from data at various scales. The aim of this article is to introduce TDA concepts to a statistical audience and provide an approach to analyzing multivariate time series data. The application’s focus will be on multivariate brain signals and brain connectivity networks. Finally, this paper concludes with an overview of some open problems and potential application of TDA to modeling directionality in a brain network, as well as the casting of TDA in the context of mixed effect models to capture variations in the topological properties of data collected from multiple subjects.},
