	abstract = {Radiomics is a procedure to access quantitative features from medical images for predictive analysis. Radiomics is used extensively for malignancy and survival analysis, genomic expression analysis, cancer progression, and assessment. But radiomics does not obtain the connected components, loops, or voids information from a region of interest. Topological data analysis is a newer approach that uses persistent homology to generate multiscale features from an image. We investigated in this study whether the topological features can be as useful as the radiomics features. Glioma grading and 1p19q codeletion assessment requires surgical biopsy, which can be error prone. To reduce biopsy error, MRI-based radiomics and topological features–based analysis were performed in our study. Topological features produced the best results for 1p19q status and tumor-grade prediction, with 94.3% (0.93 AUC) and 97.3% (0.97 AUC), respectively, which was an improvement over radiomics.

	abstract = {Diffusion MRI tractography is the only noninvasive method to measure the structural connectome in humans. However, recent validation studies have revealed limitations of modern tractography approaches, which lead to significant mistracking caused in part by local uncertainties in fiber orientations that accumulate to produce larger errors for longer streamlines. Characterizing the role of this length bias in tractography is complicated by the true underlying contribution of spatial embedding to brain topology. In this work, we compare graphs constructed with ex vivo tractography data in mice and neural tracer data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to random geometric surrogate graphs which preserve the low-order distance effects from each modality in order to quantify the role of geometry in various network properties. We find that geometry plays a substantially larger role in determining the topology of graphs produced by tractography than graphs produced by tracers. Tractography underestimates weights at long distances compared to neural tracers, which leads tractography to place network hubs close to the geometric center of the brain, as do corresponding tractography-derived random geometric surrogates, while tracer graphs place hubs further into peripheral areas of the cortex. We also explore the role of spatial embedding in modular structure, network efficiency and other topological measures in both modalities. Throughout, we compare the use of two different tractography streamline node assignment strategies and find that the overall differences between tractography approaches are small relative to the differences between tractography- and tracer-derived graphs. These analyses help quantify geometric biases inherent to tractography and promote the use of geometric benchmarking in future tractography validation efforts. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex are considered the main brain structures for allocentric representation of the external environment. Here, we show that the amygdala and the ventral visual stream are involved in allocentric representation. Thirty-one young men explored 35 virtual environments during high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and were subsequently tested on recall of the allocentric pattern of the objects in each environment—in other words, the positions of the objects relative to each other and to the outer perimeter. We find increasingly unique brain activation patterns associated with increasing allocentric accuracy in distinct neural populations in the perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, fusiform cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. In contrast to the traditional view of a hierarchical MTL network with the hippocampus at the top, we demonstrate, using recently developed graph analyses, a hierarchical allocentric MTL network without a main connector hub. © 2021 The Authors; Evensmoen et al. demonstrate that the human brain encodes scaled and true Euclidean representations of allocentric space within an extensively connected medial temporal lobe network with no main connector hub. The network includes the parahippocampal cortex, fusiform cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, perirhinal cortex, and entorhinal cortex. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Delta age is a biomarker of brain aging that captures differences between the chronological age and the predicted biological brain age. Using multimodal data of brain MRI, genomics, and blood-based biomarkers and metabolomics in UK Biobank, this study investigates an explainable and causal basis of high delta age. A visual saliency map of brain regions showed that lower volumes in the fornix and the lower part of the thalamus are key predictors of high delta age. Genome-wide association analysis of the delta age using the SNP array data identified associated variants in gene regions such as KLF3-AS1 and STX1. GWAS was also performed on the volumes in the fornix and the lower part of the thalamus, showing a high genetic correlation with delta age, indicating that they share a genetic basis. Mendelian randomization (MR) for all metabolomic biomarkers and blood-related phenotypes showed that immune-related phenotypes have a causal impact on increasing delta age. Our analysis revealed regions in the brain that are susceptible to the aging process and provided evidence of the causal and genetic connections between immune responses and brain aging. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Understanding the common topological characteristics of the human brain network across a population is central to understanding brain functions. The abstraction of human connectome as a graph has been pivotal in gaining insights on the topological properties of the brain network. The development of group-level statistical inference procedures in brain graphs while accounting for the heterogeneity and randomness still remains a difficult task. In this study, we develop a robust statistical framework based on persistent homology using the order statistics for analyzing brain networks. The use of order statistics greatly simplifies the computation of the persistent barcodes. We validate the proposed methods using comprehensive simulation studies and subsequently apply to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance images. We found a statistically significant topological difference between the male and female brain networks. Copyright: © 2023 Das et al.
